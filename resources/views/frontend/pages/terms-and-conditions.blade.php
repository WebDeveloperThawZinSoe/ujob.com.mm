            <p>Thank you for visiting <strong>ujob.com.mm</strong>. Before you use our website, please take time to read these terms and conditions. By using this site, you are agreeing to these terms. If you don’t agree, please do not use the site.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">Who Owns the Content</h5>
            <p>
                All the content you see on <strong>ujob.com.mm</strong>—like job ads, company logos, text, and website design—belongs to us. This content is protected by law.
                You cannot copy, share, or use anything from our site without permission. If you choose to make your job seeker or employer profile public, it can be seen by anyone.
                We strongly suggest not to include private or sensitive information such as your full address, NRC number, or company registration number to avoid risks like fraud or identity theft.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">How You Can Use the Website</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>ujob.com.mm</strong> is made for people in Myanmar who are looking for jobs or hiring staff. Job seekers can create profiles and apply for jobs. Employers can post jobs and search for candidates.
                Everyone must use the website honestly and responsibly. All job listings must be real. Employers must be officially registered companies in Myanmar.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">Buying Services and Making Payments</h5>
            <p>
                When you buy our services—such as posting jobs or accessing CVs—you must make sure they are suitable for your needs. All sales are final, and we do not offer refunds.
                You must pay the full amount before using the services. If you pay by card, you give us permission to charge that card according to your selected package.
                Please make sure your contact and payment information is always up to date. If your payment fails, we may pause or cancel your service.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">Service Limitations and Validity</h5>
            <p>
                Each service plan may have limits—for example, how many resumes you can view or how long a job post stays active. Most services are valid for 12 months from the date of purchase.
                After that, they will expire unless you renew or upgrade your package. We may change our pricing or service terms from time to time and will inform you if necessary.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">Wrong Use and Account Termination</h5>
            <p>
                You must not use <strong>ujob.com.mm</strong> for any illegal or harmful activity. Posting fake jobs, sharing misleading information, copying other people’s profiles,
                or trying to scam others is not allowed. If we find misuse, we have the right to delete your account and report you to the authorities.
                We may also stop services if your company faces international restrictions or legal problems.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">Links to Other Websites</h5>

            <h5 class="mt-4">Changes to These Terms</h5>
            <p>
                We may change these terms from time to time. If we do, we will update them on our website. By continuing to use <strong>ujob.com.mm</strong>, you accept the new terms.
